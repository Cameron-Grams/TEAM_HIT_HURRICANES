Project Overview:

1. Establish the virtual environment in order to use the correct versions
    requirements.txt
    
2. Collect Tweets for assessment; both of these require token configuration for access to the Twitter API
    Notebook 2.a: add_features_to_known_ids.ipynb to request by Tweet Ids
        - File 2.a.1: request_by_IDS.py file for the Twitter API call
        
    Notebook 2.b: by date-range based on known storms; requires academic access to retrieve historical Tweets
    
3. Classify Tweets in order to filter only the Tweets that are hurricane related
    Notebook 3: predict_Yes_No_hurricane.ipynb to determine YES/NO hurricane related 
    
    (*** 
    Here we can identify the work done to determine which model was best for this task; 
    	MODEL_DEVELOPMENT/3.a.YES_NO_HURRICANE.ipynb
    	MODEL_DEVELOPMENT/3.b.create_svm.ipynb
    Here we will also have to establish the text vectorizer that we will use for the remainder of the pipeline
    ***) 

4. Tweets identified as hurricane related are sent to identify which category they fall in
    ***************
    
    NEED THE LATEST FROM KI-HYUN ON THE CLASSIFIER AND EDA
    
    Here we can discuss the spot-check we performed on the classification
        Decide if/how we want to perform subcategory spot-checks

    Appendix: why we could not break down the other_relevant_information category further and the attempt
        MODEL_DEVELOPMENT/4.a.create_other_sub_categories.ipynb

5. Pipeline for the two classifiers:
    Input: collection of Tweets
    Process: process text --> YES/NO hurricane related --> categories of information --> EDA
    Output: Visualizations of patterns within the categories
