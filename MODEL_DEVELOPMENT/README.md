## Notes on Model Development
This folder contains notebooks that were used as input or to develop function used in the rest of the project. 

Notebook `4.a.create_other_sub_categories.ipynbi` as an attempt to further breakdown the "other_relevant_information" category that formed the majority of classifications.
